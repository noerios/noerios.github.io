##Portfolio Project##

Working on setting up a nice looking porfolio. Featured cards show off work/assignments/projects, there's an "about me" with contact info and skills listed, and a nav bar which currently links to my resume on my previous portfolio page. 

Built out a new body and header with Bootstrap. Bootstrap JS powers a collapseable about section header. Boostrap styling has been overwritten by some custom css.
