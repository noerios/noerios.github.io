##Portfolio Project##

Working on setting up a nice looking porfolio. Featured cards show off work/assignments/projects, there's an "about me" with contact info and skills listed, and a nav bar which currently links to my resume on my previous portfolio page. Pages will be added to go into more depth on current projects, as well as a resume page.
